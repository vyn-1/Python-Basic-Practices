# Python-Basic-Practices

This project contains the first homework assignment for the course, focused on strengthening foundational Python skills through structured exercises and a real-world challenge problem.

📘 Overview

Homework 1 is divided into several core sections that build your understanding of basic Python programming:

Part 1: Python Basics

Numbers & Variables
Practice working with data types, arithmetic, and variable assignment.

Strings
Learn how to manipulate text using slicing, indexing, formatting, and built-in methods.

Lists
Create, modify, and iterate through lists, and explore list methods and list comprehensions.

Dictionaries & Sets
Understand key–value storage, set operations, and common data manipulation techniques.

Control Flow & Functions
Write conditional statements, loops, and custom functions to build reusable logic.

Challenge Problem (Applied Real-World Task)
A practical exercise that combines multiple concepts to simulate solving a real-world programming problem.

🏁 Purpose of the Assignment
